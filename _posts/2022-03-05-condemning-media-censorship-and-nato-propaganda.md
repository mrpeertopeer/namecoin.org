The entire European Union, United Kingdom, Australia as well as American corporations such as YouTube, Google, and Meta (Facebook), have banned RT.com and Sputnik news, as well as removing apps from app stores, which we, the Namecoin community, strongly condemn.

Both RT and Sputnik were banned immediately after the Russian Federation announced Ukraine's demilitarization and de-nazification.

For years, RT has been disseminating critical information about war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by the governments of the United States of America, the United Kingdom, Australia, the European Union, and NATO (the so called "defensive alliance" which bombing Lybia, Syria, Afghanistan for decades).

The Russian Federation has thoroughly documented the war crimes and crimes against humanity committed by neo-nazis such as the Azov Battalion, which used American and NATO-supplied weapons to murder civilians, rape young girls, and behead Russian speakers even today.

It is worth noting that at the same time that the Russian Federation began this Special Operation in Ukraine, Israel bombed Syria, while the United States bombed Somalia, Yemen, and continues to loot oil from Northern Syria.
Nonetheless, no one in the European Union, Australia, or the United Kingdom has banned American news websites.

The Namecoin community strongly condemns the European Union, the government of the United States of America, Australia, and the United Kingdom for censoring news and spreading their own NATO-aligned propaganda.
